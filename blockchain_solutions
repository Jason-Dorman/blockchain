What blockchain helps solve:
	- The double spending problem

Tracking ownership in a ledger:
	Ownership != Posession
	Double spending problem:
		Someone can potentially manipulate the ledger 

	That introduces the problem - who keeps track of those records?
		Can that person be trusted?
		Who keeps track of the person who keeps the record
		And so on 
		Enter blockchain

	Boiled down:
		In the real world - big management structure problem. Lots of layers of auditing and bookeeping and tracking 

		Blockchain provides a single solution to that problem.

Blockchain allows secure transer of goods and services. Helps eliminate scams. 

Smart contracts - when deployed on top of blockchain allows transactions. 

Secured with cryptography

Distinguishing features:

Cuts out the middle man (lawyers, accountants, etc.)
Peer to Peer system secured through cryptography 
Allows deals and transactions to be completed faster
Increased Capacity:
	- due to peer to peer can increase capacity
	- thousands of computers (nodes) working together in same network

Using bitcoin to explain blockchain:
	Blockchain is the publick ledger of all bitcoin transactions that have ever taken place.
	So blockchain is constantly evolving
	The transactions that are added to the chain are being processed by computers (nodes) connected to the network
	Nodes are located around the globe making it a decentralized technology.
	Blocks are added in chronological order

Blockchain is considered part of the web 3.0 meaning:
	- Connective intelligence
	- Connecting data
	- Concepts Applications
	- Ultimately people

Blockchain helps acheive all that 

Blockchain is designed for longevity and durability
It's not owned by any single entity
One node can't control the rest

Blockchain solves the problem of manipulation
